# climbing_plan

This repository is an open source climbing plan.  
Basically I am writing a mountain climbing plan in Japan.  
However, I will accept plans for mountain climbing in other countries.  
Regarding mountain climbing plans that already exist, we accept about cases where route and time are different.  

I will accept translation requests from Japanese to English on [issue](https://github.com/ieee0824/climbing_plan/issues/new).

Let's have 🍻 on the top of mountain if you like.
